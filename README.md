# EventTrackerProject

## Description
	This project is for dog owner's who would like to keep track of the different dog kibble they have tried. Personally, my dog has an auto-immune disease and is extremely sensitive to certain foods than others. This application allows the user to log the kibble, brand, and leave a review to remind them of what kibble did or didn't work out for the health of their dog.


## Technology used 
	REST
	Java
	Eclipse

## Lessons Learned 
	<ul>
		<li>Ensure that the table id's in the database are auto-incremented or your program will fail to create a new object. I knew that I needed this but failed to implement when needed until I read my console and was able to fix the issue quickly.</li>
		<li>The service inferface works very similarly to a Data object analysis. However, the repository was the brains of the query operation. </li>
		<li>The idea of the repositories took me awhile to understand, but now I understand that the repositories are used to populate data memory from the database and how to implement one in my programs in the future.</li>
